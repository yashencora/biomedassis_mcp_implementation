In the initial assessment of a headache patient, several dangerous secondary 
etiologies must be considered. A thorough history and physical examination, 
along with a comprehensive differential diagnosis may alert a physician to the 
diagnosis of a secondary headache particularly when it is accompanied by certain 
clinical features. Evaluation and workup include a complete neurological 
examination, consideration of neuroimaging, and serum/spinal fluid analysis if 
indicated. Careful attention to the patients' history and physical examination 
will guide the diagnostic work-up and management. In this review, we summarize 
the diagnostic workup of various primary and secondary headache etiologies. 
Although most headaches are primary in nature, it is essential to screen for 
headache "red flags", as they can suggest life threatening secondary etiologies. 
When secondary causes are suspected, appropriate neuroimaging can further 
differentiate the underlying cause. The appropriate imaging is dependent on the 
most likely secondary etiology, which is deduced from history and physical 
examination. When no red flags are present, primary headaches are more likely. 
These can be differentiated by frequency, location, duration, triggers, and 
presence of aura. The different clinical presentations for secondary headaches, 
as well as the distinguishing features for primary headaches are outlined in 
this review.

Headache is the most common neurologic symptom and affects nearly half the 
world's population at any given time. Although the prevalence declines with age, 
headache remains a common neurologic complaint among elderly populations. 
Headaches can be divided into primary and secondary causes. Primary headaches 
comprise about two-thirds of headaches among the elderly. They are defined by 
clinical criteria and are diagnosed based on symptom pattern and exclusion of 
secondary causes. Primary headaches include migraine, tension-type, trigeminal 
autonomic cephalalgias, and hypnic headache. Secondary headaches are defined by 
their suspected etiology. A higher index of suspicion for a secondary headache 
disorder is warranted in older patients with new-onset headache. They are 
roughly 12 times more likely to have serious underlying causes and, frequently, 
have different symptomatic presentations compared to younger adults. Various 
imaging and laboratory evaluations are indicated in the presence of any "red 
flag" signs or symptoms. Head CT is the procedure of choice for acute headache 
presentations, and brain MRI for those with chronic headache complaints. 
Management of headache in elderly populations can be challenging due to the 
presence of multiple medical comorbidities, polypharmacy, and differences in 
drug metabolism and clearance.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Headaches are not only responsible for restrictions in 
everyday life in adults. In children and adolescents, regular headaches lead 
also to reduced life quality and limitations in the social sphere, in school 
education, and in professional careers. Here, we provide an overview on the 
frequency of headache in children and adolescents with the aim of increasing 
awareness about this particular health issue.
RECENT FINDINGS: Overall, headache prevalence in children and adolescents has 
been increasing in recent years. From various regions worldwide, data describing 
headache, its forms, and consequences are growing. In addition, factors 
frequently correlated with headache are repeatedly investigated and named: 
besides genetic factors, psychosocial and behavioral factors are linked to the 
prevalence of headache. Increasing evidence indicates that headache is 
underestimated as a common disorder in children and adolescents. Accordingly, 
too little emphasis is placed by society on its prevention and treatment. Thus, 
the extent of the social and health economic burden of frequent headaches in 
children and adolescents needs to be better illustrated, worldwide. Furthermore, 
the data collected in this review should support the efforts to improve 
outpatient therapy paths for young headache patients. Factors correlating with 
headache in pupils can draw our attention to unmet needs of these patients and 
allow physicians to derive important therapy contents from this data.

The acute headache in the emergency department (ED) poses a diagnostic dilemma 
that may overwhelm providers attempting to weigh the cost of advanced workups 
against the risk of missing serious pathology. While the majority of headache 
concerns are benign primary headache disorders, identifying life-threatening 
secondary causes of headache-which may be broadly categorized into structural, 
infectious, and vascular causes-is the primary focus of evaluation in the ED. 
Secondary headaches are associated with a high morbidity and mortality, and 
require strict scrutiny of the history and physical examination to adequately 
risk-stratify patients. Innovative and emerging technologies may further assist 
providers in the diagnosis of headache, and challenge previous gold-standard 
diagnostic evaluations. Herein, we present a general overview of the workup and 
management of headaches in the ED, with a special section for diagnostic 
considerations in evaluating for acute meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 
acute angle-closure glaucoma.

Family medicine physicians often see headache as the chief complaint when 
meeting patients within their practice. The goal is to try different treatment 
modalities without having to send the patient to a specialist. Headaches affect 
different individuals during their lifetime. Before any treatment begins, it is 
best that one rules out possible causes of the headache, for example, drug 
interactions or structural cerebrum conditions. Nonpharmacological treatment is 
recommended first before attempting a stepwise approach to cost-effective 
pharmacological treatment options. Pharmacological treatment options should 
include preventive and on-demand options. A family physician has all the 
resources to assist patients with different types of headaches.

Pediatric headaches attributed to infection are typically related to non-life 
threatening illnesses such as upper respiratory tract infections and 
rhinosinusitis. Although less common, secondary headaches related to life 
threatening infections are most frequently associated with meningitis. This 
review provides an overview of the International Classification of Headache 
Disorders third edition (ICHD-3) categories of infections contributing to 
secondary headache, describes clinical presentation, and presents a focused 
review on relevant diagnoses associated with this headache type. An 
understanding of headache attributed to infection will provide the foundation on 
distinguishing secondary headaches from various etiological infectious 
disorders.

The relationship between headache and multiple sclerosis (MS) has been a matter 
of controversy for over 60 years. Headaches are still rated as a "red flag", 
indicating alternative diagnoses to MS, although in the last few years numerous 
studies have shown a frequent association between headache and MS. In recent 
studies on MS patients, a link was found between lower age/shorter disease 
duration of MS and frequent headaches. A study of 50 patients manifesting MS for 
the first time showed the highest headache prevalence in MS of 78% reported so 
far.Headaches can also be a possible side effect of most disease-modifying MS 
drugs. In many cases, however, the headache appears to be a symptom of MS in 
terms of secondary headache. This is also supported by pathophysiological 
implications, for example, by detecting B cell follicles in the meninges of MS 
patients.Migraine is the most common type of headache in MS. In some cases, this 
is a comorbidity of two diseases with many similarities, but headaches caused by 
inflammatory MS lesions also appear to be phenomenologically very similar to 
classic migraines; thus, distinguishing between them is often only successful 
with the help of thorough differential diagnostics (cerebrospinal fluid, MRI 
etc.).The task of future studies must be to specify the phenomenology of 
headache in MS even more precisely, in order to, to gain knowledge in, among 
others, patients with radiologically isolated syndrome, who often suffer from 
headache, because in these patients a considerable differential diagnostic and 
therapeutic uncertainty exists.

Headache and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) are inextricably linked. Although in 
some cases headache complicating CVD may be little more than a symptomatic 
afterthought, in other cases, early recognition of headache's role in the CVD 
process is critical to effective management. In other words, headaches secondary 
to CVD span a spectrum, and in this article, we will review that spectrum.

Post-dural puncture headache belongs to the group of secondary headache 
disorders and is a typical complication of intended or unintended dural 
puncture. The main symptom is orthostatic headache, which can be accompanied by 
neurological symptoms such as diplopia depending on the extent of the 
cerebrospinal fluid leak. The course of this headache is predominantly benign, 
showing spontaneous improvement over a couple of days, although severe cases are 
described in the literature. The following article provides an overview of the 
current knowledge about the headache's pathophysiology, diagnostic work-up and 
therapy.

Evaluation of headache in patients with cancer.

Bernstein CA(1).

Author information:
(1)Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.

Headache is a common complaint and is often benign. When patients with cancer 
describe new headaches, it is important to ensure that there are no emergent or 
concerning etiologies, including metastatic disease. This review article details 
primary and secondary headaches. Red flags-the do-not-miss warning signs-are 
described. An initial approach to the evaluation, including suggestions for 
imaging, features to look for in a targeted examination, and when to request a 
consultation, is outlined. An overview of headache etiologies is described with 
a particular emphasis on the most common types: migraine and tension. The 
classification of headaches, based on criteria from the International 
Classification of Headache Disorders (3rd edition; beta version), is reviewed. 
Medications used for treatment, including newer biological agents, are 
described, and there are details about both abortive and preventive medication 
therapies. Suggestions for complementary and integrative therapies, some of 
which may be synergistic in treating other cancer symptoms, are outlined; they 
include mindfulness therapies, which are gaining traction in treating a variety 
of medical conditions. Readers should have an understanding of headache 
evaluation in patients with cancer and should know how to formulate a plan for a 
diagnosis. In addition, readers will gain familiarity with common treatments, 
both pharmacological and complementary/integrative.

A clinician's goal when encountering acute headaches is to distinguish primary 
and secondary headache disorders. A comprehensive history, screening for warning 
signs of secondary headache, and a physical examination can help determine if 
further workup is necessary. While neurodiagnostic testing is not indicated for 
individuals with a history of primary headache disorders with typical symptoms, 
individuals with atypical signs or symptoms may warrant brain imaging with MRI 
brain, CT head, CT angiogram, CTV, MRV, conventional cerebral angiography, spine 
imaging, and/or lumbar puncture. Secondary headaches should be treated for their 
underlying cause. Primary headache disorders have specific evidence-based 
treatments that can help with acute pain relief.

Headache is a common complaint for which parents seek pediatrician's consult. 
Headaches are seen in increasing frequency from 3 y of age onwards with peaks in 
older children and adolescents. In children, secondary headaches due to 
underlying etiologies are far more common than primary headaches due to 
migraine. Recognition of temporal pattern of headache along with focused 
neurological examination will help in narrowing down the etiology. The key goal 
in urgent care assessment is to identify children with underlying serious 
illnesses that require stabilization and urgent referral. For benign causes, 
symptomatic treatment with analgesics like paracetamol or ibuprofen would 
suffice initially, while identification of the underlying condition would lead 
to further appropriate management, particularly in primary headaches.

Pediatric Headache.

Hershey AD.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Headache is one of the most common health concerns in 
children and adolescents, yet remains underrecognized as a disease. A variety of 
factors, including the unique aspects of childhood headaches, contribute to this 
underrecognition.
RECENT FINDINGS: Improving recognition of childhood and adolescent headaches and 
using a standardized approach for their evaluation is expected to lead to the 
appropriate diagnosis and subsequent additional evaluation and management to 
improve the overall outcome in children and adolescents with headaches. Building 
on limited studies in children and adolescents and translating adult studies to 
children can assist in designing a multidisciplinary treatment plan.
SUMMARY: This review focuses on some of the unique aspects of evaluating 
children and adolescents with headaches; the impact of these headaches on 
school, home, and family function; determination of disability and influence of 
comorbid conditions; and development of a treatment plan that incorporates 
acute, preventive, and biobehavioral management tools.

Ocular causes of headaches include headaches associated with refractive error 
(HARE), convergence insufficiency (CI), and accommodative spasm (AS). HARE is 
more severe in patients with a high amount of refractive error. CI or AS 
patients can have diplopia and strabismus. Both CI and AS can be associated with 
head trauma or other systemic disorders. Headaches due to ocular causes are 
frontally localized occurring near the end of the day and are associated with 
increased amount of near work. HARE is treated with glasses while CI or AS may 
need other therapies such as prism, eye drops, surgery, or orthoptic exercises.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Headache phenotypes can differ between adults and children. 
While most headaches are due to primary headache disorders, in a small 
population, they can be an indication of a potentially life-threatening 
neurologic condition. The challenge lies in identifying warning signs that 
warrant further workup. This article reviews different types of pediatric 
headaches and headache evaluation in children and teens, and focuses on the 
approach for diagnosis of secondary headaches.
RECENT FINDINGS: Common thought is that increased frequency and severity of 
headache may reflect secondary pathology; however, headache phenotype may not be 
fully developed and can evolve in adolescence or adulthood. Headache location, 
particularly occipital headache alone, does not necessarily signify secondary 
intracranial pathology. Certain warning signs warrant neuroimaging, but others 
only warrant imaging in certain clinical contexts. Brain MRI is the neuroimaging 
modality of choice, though there is a high rate of incidental findings and often 
does not change headache management. A stepwise approach is essential to avoid 
missing secondary headaches. There are several differences between adults and 
children in clinical manifestations of headache. Evaluation and diagnosis of 
pediatric headache starts with a thorough headache and medical history, family 
and social history, and identification of risk factors. A thorough physical and 
neurologic exam is important, with close attention to features that could 
suggest secondary headache pathology. Neuroimaging and other testing should only 
be performed if there is concern for secondary headache.

Childhood Headache: A Brief Review.

Blume HK.

Headaches are common in childhood and adolescence and can cause significant 
distress and disability for a child and their family. Providers need to be able 
to identify "red flags" for worrisome causes of secondary headaches and 
recognize typical primary headache characteristics to provide each patient with 
the best possible care to improve their quality of life and minimize disability. 
This article reviews the epidemiology of headaches in children, signs and 
symptoms of secondary headaches, definitions of some primary childhood 
headaches, and options for management of both acute and chronic pediatric 
migraine. [Pediatr Ann. 2017;46(4):e155-e165.].

Primary headaches are most common in women during their reproductive years and 
are affected by the hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy. Most headaches 
follow a benign course during pregnancy, although migraine is associated with 
increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and stroke. Management of 
primary headaches during pregnancy is essentially similar to management in the 
nonpregnant state, with a few exceptions. This article reviews the epidemiology, 
prognosis, and management of primary headaches during pregnancy and lactation, 
and considers secondary headaches that are important to exclude.

Headache and seizures are two of the most common complaints seen in the field of 
pediatric neurology with headache being number one. Both these conditions may 
coexist. Where the difficulty begins is when the symptoms are not clear cut in 
making a diagnosis, and conditions are possible as either an atypical seizure or 
migraine variant. What further complicates matters is the fact that there are 
many underlying neurologic conditions that carry with them a higher likelihood 
of developing both headaches and seizures, making each a distinct possibility 
when obtaining a history from a parent about unusual spells. Although 
differentiating between seizure and headache may not be easy, with a focused yet 
thorough history and appropriate use of investigative tools, it can be done. 
Coming to the correct diagnosis is only the start; once seizures and or 
headaches have been appropriately diagnosed then the real challenge begins and 
that is finding a way to successfully treat the headaches and seizures. Within 
pediatric neurology, the acute options tend to be more diagnosis specific 
whereas the prophylactic ones may overlap and treat both headaches and seizures. 
In the following review, we will discuss the epidemiology of pediatric headaches 
and seizures, the overlap between these 2 conditions in diagnosis, as well as 
how to tell them apart, and the treatment options and prognosis of both common 
neurologic disorders in children.

BACKGROUND: Although some causes of rhinogenic headache, such as acute 
sinusitis, have clear diagnostic criteria, others, such as "sinus headache" and 
mucosal contact points, are more nebulous. Misdiagnosis of these entities and 
primary headaches may result in unnecessary medical or surgical treatment. The 
purpose of this systematic review is to delineate current understanding of 
diagnosis and treatment of rhinogenic headaches, including sinus and mucosal 
contact point headaches, in children.
METHODS: PubMed, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane databases were searched for studies on 
sinus headache and mucosal contact point headaches in children. Studies were 
assessed for level of evidence, and risk of bias was assessed by Methodological 
Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) scoring. Diagnostic criteria, 
management strategies, and other clinical data were analyzed.
RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Level of evidence was 
predominantly 4. Forty percent of pediatric patients with migraine had been 
previously misdiagnosed with sinus headache. Of 327 pediatric patients in two 
studies, between 55% and 73% had at least 1 cranial autonomic symptom associated 
with their migraine. For children with mucosal contact point headaches, surgical 
management in select patients improved headache intensity or severity in 17 
(89%) cases.
CONCLUSION: The majority of pediatric patients with sinus headache harbor a 
primary headache disorder, with migraine being most common. Physicians should 
suspect primary headache disorders in pediatric patients with chronic headaches 
and a normal exam. Although some case series are supportive of surgical 
management for mucosal contact point headaches in children, the level of 
evidence supporting these recommendations is insufficient. High-quality clinical 
trials are necessary for continuing to improve outcomes in patients with these 
clinical entities.

Headache is one of the most common neurologic disorders in children with a 
prevalence between 57-82 %. Affecting only 2.5 per 100,000 persons of the 
pediatric population, brain tumors in children is less common, but frequently 
present with headache. However, headache rarely presents as the sole neurologic 
symptom of a brain tumor in children. According to the International 
Classification of Headache Disorders Third Edition (ICHD-3), a headache may be 
attributed to a brain tumor if it is in close temporal relation with the tumor, 
worsens in parallel with the tumor, and/or improves after the successful 
treatment of the tumor. Brain tumor headaches are traditionally thought to 
display specific characteristics, including severe pain intensity, morning 
occurrence and association with nausea or vomiting. There are no formal criteria 
for headache attributed to brain tumor in children in ICHD-3. In this review we 
provide an overview of the ICHD-3 criteria and clinical presentation, and 
management of headaches attributed to brain tumors in children.

[Headache disorders].

[Article in Japanese]

Takeshima T(1), Kikui S.

Primary headache disorders such as migraine, tension-type headache, and cluster 
headache are prevalent and disabling neurological disorders. Although most 
headache disorders are largely treatable, they are under-recognized, 
under-diagnosed, and under-treated. Many headache sufferers in Japan do not 
receive appropriate and effective health care; hence, the illness, which should 
be relieved, persists and acts as an individual and societal burden. One of the 
barriers most responsible for this is poor awareness of the disorders. For 
lifting the burden, health care must be improved. Education is an essential way 
to resolve these issues at multiple levels. We have a Japanese version of the 
international headache classification and diagnostic criteria II (ICHD-II) and 
guidelines for the management of chronic headaches. Utilization of these 
resources is key for the improvement of headache management in our country. Not 
only neurologists, but also neurosurgeons and other medical specialists are 
participating in headache care in Japan. The Japanese Headache Society and the 
Japanese Society for Neurology should play major roles in health care service, 
education programs, as well as clinical and basic research for headache 
disorders. The road map for realizing our aim on headache treatment is as 
follows: (1) increase the number of units concerning headache in lectures for 
medical students, implement training programs for residents and neurologists, 
and offer continuous medical educations for physicians and neurologists; (2) 
secure more funding for headache research; (3) propagate medical care for 
headache in primary care settings and regional fundamental hospitals; (4) reform 
the health care system for headache and incentivize appropriate compensation for 
headache care in public health insurance; and (5) spread appropriate information 
on medical and socio-ethical issues related to headache for the sufferers and 
citizens. The authors expect that many neurologists have an interest in headache 
and understanding headaches, and better health care for headache disorders will 
bring great benefits for the sufferers.

BACKGROUND: Headache is a common, yet challenging symptom to evaluate given its 
wide range of clinical presentations and different etiologies. For centuries, 
conceptual understanding of headache causation has been attributed to anatomic 
abnormalities of the nose and paranasal sinuses.
METHODS: Structured literature review.
RESULTS: The number of cases, categorized as migraines or other primary 
headaches, misdiagnosed as a "sinus headache" is high in the literature, ranging 
from 50 to 80%. The potential mechanisms for rhinogenic headaches were 
classically described as pain secondary to prolonged mucosal contact points, 
hypoxia in the paranasal sinuses secondary to poor ventilation, or pressure 
caused by the growth of nasal polyps. Additionally, other mechanisms were 
described and are still being studied. Corrective surgery for mucosal contact 
points in the nasal cavity is deemed necessary for relieving the headache, 
although patient outcomes are variable.
CONCLUSION: Delay in proper diagnosis and treatment negatively impact patient 
quality of life. Most cases of "sinus headache" or "rhinogenic headache" seen in 
clinical practice are in fact misdiagnosed as either primary headaches or 
migraines. Because of increased misdiagnoses, Otolaryngologists should establish 
a direct and precise diagnosis congruent with a chief complaint being a 
headache. Vital information such as a good clinical history, well-performed 
nasal endoscopy, and occasional CT scan may decrease misdiagnosis probability.

Headache in pregnancy.

Macgregor EA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an overview of the diagnosis and 
management of primary and secondary headaches that may occur during pregnancy 
and postpartum. Headache presenting in pregnancy is of significant concern to 
the affected woman. Quick and correct diagnosis leads to the optimal management, 
minimizing risks to the pregnancy.
RECENT FINDINGS: Several strategies have been developed to distinguish secondary 
headaches that need urgent assessment and management from benign primary and 
secondary headaches and to minimize the risk of misdiagnosis. Recent guidelines 
for the drug treatment of headaches are considered in the context of updated 
information on the safety of drugs in pregnancy and lactation.
SUMMARY: Primary headaches are common and typically improve during pregnancy. 
Management during pregnancy and lactation is similar to management in the 
nonpregnant state, with a few exceptions. Secondary causes of headache that are 
more likely to occur during pregnancy include cerebral venous thrombosis, 
posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome resulting from eclampsia, 
post-dural puncture headache, stroke, and pituitary apoplexy.

Headache is a frequent symptom in women of childbearing age and during 
pregnancy. Benign and pathologic headaches may change in response to changes in 
estrogen after conception. Expected patterns of change are described for 
headaches that occur commonly during pregnancy. In addition, although treatment 
options are limited during pregnancy, a variety of effective medication and 
nonmedication treatments are available and should be offered to women with 
benign headaches that persist into the second trimester of pregnancy.

Chronic daily headache represents a range of disorders characterized by the 
occurrence of long-duration headache 15 or more days per month. The 
classification of these disorders continues to undergo revision to make them 
more clinically relevant, such as that which has been most controversial, the 
classification of chronic migraine. The role of medication overuse in what has 
commonly been known as rebound headache can have a significant influence on 
these disorders. The diagnosis of the chronic daily headaches, including chronic 
migraine and chronic tension-type headache, truly cannot be made if patients are 
having medication-overuse headache. This article reviews the criteria for 
medication-overuse headache and the subset of headaches making up chronic daily 
headache, as well as the epidemiologic and therapeutic aspects of these 
disorders.

[Headache: classification and diagnosis].

[Article in Dutch; Abstract available in Dutch from the publisher]

Carbaat PA, Couturier EG.

There are many types of headache and, moreover, many people have different types 
of headache at the same time. Adequate treatment is possible only on the basis 
of the correct diagnosis. Technically and in terms of content the current 
diagnostics process for headache is based on the 'International Classification 
of Headache Disorders' (ICHD-3-beta) that was produced under the auspices of the 
International Headache Society. This classification is based on a distinction 
between primary and secondary headaches. The most common primary headache types 
are the tension type headache, migraine and the cluster headache. Application of 
uniform diagnostic concepts is essential to come to the most appropriate 
treatment of the various types of headache.

Several lines of evidence support a role of the immune system in headache 
pathogenesis, with particular regard to migraine. Firstly, alterations in 
cytokine profile and in lymphocyte subsets have been reported in headache 
patients. Secondly, several genetic and environmental pathogenic factors seem to 
be frequently shared by headache and immunological/autoimmune diseases. 
Accordingly, immunological alterations in primary headaches, in particular in 
migraine, have been suggested to predispose some patients to the development of 
immunological and autoimmune diseases. On the other hand, pathogenic mechanisms 
underlying autoimmune disorders, in some cases, seem to favour the onset of 
headache. Therefore, an association between headache and 
immunological/autoimmune disorders has been thoroughly investigated in the last 
years. The knowledge of this possible association may have relevant implications 
in the clinical practice when deciding diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. 
The present review summarizes findings to date regarding the plausible 
relationship between headache and immunological/autoimmune disorders, starting 
from a description of immunological alteration of primary headaches, and moving 
onward to the evidence supporting a potential link between headache and each 
specific autoimmune/immunological disease.

BACKGROUND: Nummular headache and epicrania fugax are two primary headaches that 
fall under the heading of epicranial headaches.
METHODS: This article reviews the epidemiological and clinical features of 
nummular headache and epicrania fugax, proposed pathogenic mechanisms and 
state-of-the-art management, according to the literature.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Nummular headache and epicrania fugax are generally 
viewed as rare headache disorders, but no population-based epidemiological data 
are available. Nummular headache is characterized by continuous or intermittent 
head pain, which remains circumscribed in a round or oval area of the scalp, 
typically one to six centimeters in diameter. Epicrania fugax manifests with 
brief paroxysms of pain that move along the surface of the head, following a 
linear or zigzag trajectory through different nerve territories. Nummular 
headache and epicrania fugax are mostly primary headaches, but some secondary 
cases have been reported. The pathogenesis of these headaches is not fully 
understood. Nummular headache could probably originate in epicranial tissues or 
adjacent intracranial structures, while the origin of epicrania fugax could be 
extracranial or intracranial. Diagnostic assessment requires careful examination 
of the symptomatic areas. Underlying disorders should be excluded by additional 
investigations, including neuroimaging and appropriate blood tests. No 
controlled clinical trials have been conducted in nummular headache or epicrania 
fugax. Analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, botulinum toxin and gabapentin 
are currently the most recommended treatment options for nummular headache. In 
epicrania fugax, the most used treatments are gabapentin, lamotrigine, and other 
antiseizure medications.

Pain, including headache, is a frequent complaint of individuals with multiple 
sclerosis (MS). Prevalence of headache in patients with MS was reported to be 
higher than 50%, but it is uncertain if this is different than what is seen in 
the general population. Nonetheless, it is possible that MS and headaches are 
comorbid. Case reports illustrated that isolated MS lesions (eg, in "strategic" 
regions like the midbrain) may cause severe headaches often resembling migraine. 
Furthermore, the role of MS disease-modifying agents needs to be taken into 
consideration. Mode of action and side effect profiles differ, and treatment per 
se may sometimes trigger headache in patients with MS. Thorough evaluation of 
headache in patients with MS is crucial to optimize patient management to help 
improve quality of life.

Post-dural puncture headache belongs to the group of secondary headache 
disorders and is a typical complication of intended or unintended dural 
puncture. The main symptom is orthostatic headache, which can be accompanied by 
neurological symptoms such as diplopia depending on the extent of the 
cerebrospinal fluid leak. The course of this headache is predominantly benign, 
showing spontaneous improvement over a couple of days, although severe cases are 
described in the literature. The following article provides an overview of the 
current knowledge about the headache's pathophysiology, diagnostic work-up and 
therapy.

Santander, Spain. juliopascual@telefonica.net

Primary cough headache is defined as head pain brought on by coughing or other 
Valsalva maneuvers, but not by prolonged physical exercise, in the absence of 
any intracranial disorder. Primary cough headache is considered to be a rare 
condition, accounting for 0.4% of all headaches consulting our Neurology 
Department. Its pathophysiology remains a mystery. Primary cough headache is a 
sudden-onset headache that usually lasts from 1 second to 30 minutes, tends to 
be bilateral and posterior, does not begin earlier than the fifth decade of 
life, is more frequent in men, is not accompanied by other neurologic 
manifestations, and responds to indomethacin. These clinical characteristics 
allow its differential diagnosis from other entities, even though a 
craniocervical magnetic resonance imaging study is mandatory to rule out 
posterior fossa lesions, especially Chiari type-I malformation.

Headache is a common symptom of acute and chronic cerebrovascular diseases. 
Headache can be symptomatic in patients with various forms of vascular pathology 
of the brain but primary headaches are much more common. Secondary headaches in 
acute cerebrovascular accidents may be the first symptom, and in some cases, a 
risk factor or complication of stroke. In chronic cerebrovascular diseases, 
headache may be the predominant symptom in the early stages and resolve in the 
later stages of the disease. At the same time, the severity, nature and course 
of headache cannot be considered as reliable signs of cerebrovascular disease. 
Meanwhile, the verification of the headache form is important from the point of 
view of determining the priorities of diagnosis and therapy.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Headaches are a common, oftentimes debilitating symptom in 
patients with leptomeningeal metastases.
RECENT FINDINGS: The third edition of the International Classification of 
Headache Disorders provides a useful diagnostic framework for headaches 
secondary to leptomeningeal metastases based on the temporal relationship of 
headache with disease onset, change in headache severity in correlation with 
leptomeningeal disease burden, and accompanying neurologic signs such as cranial 
nerve palsies and encephalopathy. However, headaches in patients with 
leptomeningeal metastases can be further defined by a wide range of varying 
cancer- and treatment-related pathophysiologies, each requiring a tailored 
approach. A thorough review of the literature and expert opinion on five 
observed headache sub-classifications in patients with leptomeningeal metastases 
is provided, with attention to necessary diagnostic testing, recommended 
first-line treatments, and prevention strategies.

Huygens' headache.

Koehler PJ(1).

Author information:

pkoehler@neurohistory.nl.

BACKGROUND: Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) was a Dutch mathematician, physicist, 
and astronomer. He became well-known as inventor of the pendulum clock and 
described light as a wave phenomenon. He became Fellow of the Royal Society 
(London) and member of the Académie des Sciences (Paris). From the 
correspondence with family members and famous scientists, we learn that he 
suffered from frequent headaches.
AIM: To study Huygens' 22-volume Oeuvres Complètes (1888-1950) to find letters 
in which his headaches are mentioned and translate pertinent sections into 
English.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a posthumous diagnosis of Huygens' headaches is somewhat 
hazardous, the recurrent episodes with incapacitating headache and family 
history over two generations are suggestive for migraine. It becomes clear that 
it impeded his writing, reading, and research. From the letters we get an 
impression of the impact of the headache upon his life and the treatments that 
were applied in the 17th century.

Headaches are a global health problem and are encountered by a variety of 
specialties, including otolaryngologists. These patients can present as a 
challenge, but an understanding of primary and secondary headache disorders and 
the accompanying broad differential diagnosis is critical. For secondary 
headache disorders, a differential diagnosis categorized by anatomic location 
can help organize the evaluation of these patients, which can then be narrowed 
by the history and examination findings. Additional ancillary tests such as 
laboratories and imaging can further aid in diagnosis but are not always 
necessary.

At least half of women migraineurs experience menstrual migraine (MM), 
suggesting a hormonal explanation for the incidence of these headaches. Basic 
science efforts suggest a relationship between estrogen and the 
neurotransmitters and neuronal structures critical in the pathophysiology of 
migraine. The notion that MM is more severe, longer in duration, and more 
resistant to treatment than headaches occurring at other times during the 
menstrual cycle may apply more to women seeking treatment for their headaches 
than to migraineurs in the general population. Triptans have been shown to be 
effective as both an abortive and short-term preventive treatment, and estradiol 
has been shown to be an effective short-term preventive treatment. Ergotamines, 
combinations of drugs such as sumatriptan-naproxen sodium, and rizatriptan with 
dexamethasone show promise in the treatment of MM.

Common Primary and Secondary Causes of Headache in the Elderly.

Sharma TL(1).

Author information:
(1)Neurological Institute Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.

OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Headache in the elderly, defined as individuals aged 65 
and older, although less prevalent than younger individuals, can present as a 
diagnostic challenge, given the increase in potentially fatal diseases within 
this population.
METHODS: These individuals require a complete history, neurological examination, 
and assessment of potential secondary causes of headaches.
RESULTS: Secondary causes include temporal or giant cell arteritis, subdural 
hematomas, central nervous system (CNS) tumors, strokes, and CNS infections. 
Once secondary conditions are ruled out, then primary causes of headache are 
considered such as tension-type headache, migraine, cluster headache, or hypnic 
headache.
CONCLUSION: This article reviews the distinguishing characteristics of the most 
common types of headache in patients over the age of 65 years old, along with 
potential diagnostic tests and treatment.

OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the data collected using a headache diary mobile 
application to characterize posttraumatic headaches (PTHs) in a sample of US 
veterans. Specifically, we measured patient engagement with the mobile 
application and compared our findings with previous literature regarding PTHs.
SETTING: A Headache Center of Excellence (HCoE) in a Veterans Health 
Administration facility.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine veterans currently being treated for ongoing 
PTH-related complaints with English fluency, reliable access to the internet, 
and a mobile phone.
DESIGN: Observational study of PTH characteristics using the mobile application 
over the course of 1 year.
MEASURES: Main outcome measures were collected via a headache diary mobile 
application developed for patients to track headache-associated symptoms, 
headache location, triggers, type, intensity, and duration. Patients also 
completed a baseline Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) survey.
RESULTS: In total, 1569 entries were completed during the first year of 
application deployment. On average, patients completed 2.5 entries per week and 
used the application for 70 days. They frequently reported associated PTH 
symptoms of photophobia (56.7%) and headaches triggered by emotional stress 
(35.1%). Network analyses revealed patterns of co-occurrence in triggers of 
headache pain, associated symptoms, and headache pain location. Headache pain 
severity and impact ratings from the headache diary demonstrated convergent 
validity with the established HIT-6 measure.
CONCLUSIONS: Headache diary mobile applications are a promising tool for 
monitoring and characterizing PTHs in veterans. Present results mirror past 
studies of PTH characteristics. Mobile application headache diaries may be used 
in both clinical and research settings to monitor headache symptoms and 
communicate the functional impact of headaches in real time.

For decades, the headache was not considered a typical symptom of multiple 
sclerosis (MS) and was construed as a "red flag" for important differential 
diagnoses such as cerebral vasculitis. Meanwhile, several studies have 
demonstrated an increased prevalence of headaches in MS compared to the general 
population. This is due to the heterogeneity of headache genesis with frequent 
occurrence of both primary and secondary headaches in MS. On the one hand, MS 
and migraine are often comorbid. On the other hand, secondary headaches 
frequently occur, especially in the course of MS relapses. These are often 
migraine-like headaches caused by inflammation, which can improve as a result of 
MS-specific therapy. Headaches are particularly common in the early stages of 
chronic inflammatory CNS disease, where inflammatory activity is the greatest. 
In addition, headaches can also occur as a side effect of disease-modifying 
drugs (DMDs). Headache can occur with most DMDs and is most frequently described 
with interferon-beta therapy. The aim of this work is to present the prevalence 
of headaches and describe the heterogeneity of possible causes of headaches in 
MS. In addition, important therapeutic aspects in the treatment of MS patients, 
in general, will be presented as well as different approaches to the treatment 
of headaches in MS depending on the etiological classification.

Primary Headache Attributed to External Compression or Traction to the Head: A 
Narrative Review.

(3)Department of Neurology, St. Georg Hospital, Leipzig, Germany.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this review is to synthesize the existing knowledge 
regarding headaches attributed to external physical stimuli, as classified by 
the ICHD-3 (Group 4.6). Two forms can be distinguished in this group: (1) 
headache attributed to external compression and (2) headache attributed to 
external traction.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using the Medline 
(PubMed) database and other relevant academic sources. All English-language 
articles were subjected to a relevance assessment.
RESULTS: The prevalence of the two types of headache varies considerably, with a 
higher incidence observed in women or in the presence of predisposing factors 
(e.g., work with compulsory helmets or long hair). An external-compression 
headache is typically described as a pressing sensation, whereas an 
external-traction headache is characterized by a sensation of pulling. The 
headaches typically persist for less than an hour after the stimulus has ceased, 
and the intensity is typically reported as mild to moderate. Apart from avoiding 
the trigger, which is not always possible, effective therapies have not been 
established.
CONCLUSION: Both types of headaches are relatively common, yet they remain 
underrepresented in the scientific literature. Furthermore, there is a dearth of 
comprehensive overviews. If the triggering factor cannot be eliminated, both 
types of headaches can interfere with daily living and working.

Universidade de Pernambuco (UPE), Recife, Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Craniocervical dystonia is a focal or segmental dystonia in its 
distribution, classically known as spasmodic torticollis when in its pure 
cervical presentation. Although craniocervical dystonia has been recognized as a 
possible cause of headache since the publication of the second version of 
International Classification of Headache Disorders, there are few studies about 
this entity.
METHOD: This was a narrative review.
RESULTS: Craniocervical dystonia was associated with muscle pain in 67-89% of 
the cases. Headaches of any kind affected approximately 60% of patients with 
craniocervical dystonia, and were located mainly in the occipital and cervical 
regions. Headache attributed to craniocervical dystonia specifically was rarely 
found, and it was described in only one patient out of 80 in one study. 
Treatment with botulinum neurotoxin is considered to be the first-line treatment 
for focal dystonias, including craniocervical dystonia, and besides reducing 
clinical severity, impairment, and pain scores among the patients with 
craniocervical dystonia, there were also descriptions of improvements in 
headaches attributed to craniocervical dystonia and other headaches associated 
with this dystonia.
CONCLUSIONS: Headache attributed to craniocervical dystonia has been poorly 
studied. There is a need for more studies to evaluate its characteristics and 
treatment.

Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a chief complaint of 
headache are common and are frequently clinically challenging. The primary role 
of ED physicians is to discriminate between the most common primary benign 
headaches and secondary potentially life-threatening headaches. There are 
several tools at the physician's disposal to corroborate the diagnosis 
(anamnesis, examination, neuroimaging, lumbar puncture), but in the busy setting 
of the ED they are often inadequately used with respect to published standards 
and recommendations. In 2004 a multidisciplinary workgroup of the Emilia-Romagna 
region proposed a consensus-based diagnostic algorithm structured in four 
clinical scenarios aimed at reducing the variability exhibited by ED physicians 
in management of non-traumatic headache, improving clinical decision-making and 
optimising the use of limited resources.

The interrelations between headache/migraine and epileptic seizures are an 
interesting topic, still lacking a systematization, which is the objective of 
the present revision. We organize the general setting on: (a) a distinction 
between pre-ictal, ictal, post-ictal and inter-ictal headaches, assuming "ictal" 
as epileptic seizure, and (b) the kind of headache, if it is of migraine type or 
not. Concerning pre-ictal migraine/headache, the necessity of its 
differentiation from an epileptic headache presenting as an aura of a seizure is 
stressed; this is connected with the indefiniteness of the term "migralepsy". 
The term "migraine aura-triggered seizure" should be used only in front of a 
proven triggering effect of migraine. Epileptic headache (called also "ictal 
epileptic headache") is a well-characterized entity, in which different types of 
head pain may occur and an ictal EEG is necessary for the diagnosis. It may 
present as an isolated event ("isolated epileptic headache"), requiring a 
differential diagnosis from other kinds of headache, or it may be 
uninterruptedly followed by other epileptic manifestations being in this case 
easily identifiable as an epileptic aura. Hemicrania epileptica is a very rare 
variant of epileptic headache, characterized by the ipsilaterality of head pain 
and EEG paroxysms. Ictal non-epileptic headache needs to be differentiated from 
epileptic headache. Post-ictal headaches are a frequent association of headache 
with seizures, particularly in patients suffering also from inter-ictal 
headache-migraine. The reported systematization of the topic led us to suggest a 
classification which is shown in Appendix.

Post-traumatic headaches as well as post-traumatic syndrome can occur in 
patients after mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury. Most of the 
patients' symptoms clear within the first 3 to 6 months; however, there are no 
precise criteria for predicting the clinical outcome. The diagnostic criteria 
for post-traumatic headaches were defined by the International Headache Society 
in 2004 and are helpful for classification. Evaluation must be done on an 
individual basis, and patients who do not clear their symptoms may need 
neuroimaging. The headaches fall into the category of chronic tension-type 
headache as well as headaches compatible with migraine and are treated in a 
similar fashion. There is a small group of people who do not respond and have 
long-term problems. These patients may benefit from a combination of 
pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and neuropsychiatric treatment. Long-term 
studies are needed to help clarify the history of these patients.

Migraine affects over 40 million Americans and is the world's second most 
disabling condition. As the majority of medical care for migraine occurs in 
primary care settings, not in neurology nor headache subspecialty practices, 
healthcare system interventions should focus on primary care. Though there is 
grade A evidence for behavioral treatment (e.g., biofeedback, cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT), and relaxation techniques) for migraine, these 
treatments are underutilized. Behavioral treatments may be a valuable 
alternative to opioids, which remain widely used for migraine, despite the US 
opioid epidemic and guidelines that recommend against them. Identifying and 
removing barriers to the use of headache behavioral therapy could help reduce 
the disability as well as the personal and social costs of migraine. These 
techniques will have their greatest impact if offered in primary care settings 
to the lower socioeconomic status groups at greatest risk for migraine. We 
review the societal and cultural challenges that impose barriers to optimal use 
of non-pharmacological treatment services. These barriers include insufficient 
knowledge of migraine/headache behavioral treatments and insufficient 
availability of clinicians trained in non-pharmacological treatment delivery; 
limited access in underserved communities; financial burden; and stigma 
associated with both headache and mental health diagnoses and treatment. For 
each barrier, we discuss potential approaches to minimizing its effect and thus 
enhancing non-pharmacological treatment utilization.Case ExampleA 25-year-old 
graduate student with a prior history of headaches in college is attending 
school in the evenings while working a full-time job. Now, his headaches have 
significant nausea and photophobia. They are twice weekly and are disabling 
enough that he is unable to complete homework assignments. He does not 
understand why the headaches occur on Saturdays when he pushes through all week 
to get through his examinations that take place on Friday evenings. He tried two 
different migraine preventive medications, but neither led to the 50% reduction 
in headache days his doctor had hoped for. His doctor had suggested cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) before initiating the medications, but he had been too 
busy to attend the appointments, and the challenges in finding an in-network 
provider proved difficult. Now with the worsening headaches, he opted for the 
CBT and by the fifth week had already noted improvements in his headache 
frequency and intensity.

Before Sjaastad coined the term cervicogenic headache (CR) 15 years ago, 
neck-related headaches have been considered by different authors for many years. 
Even after the publication of diagnostic criteria, dispute on the clinical 
picture, differential diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment of CR still 
persists. A paper published in 1949 by Josey reports on 6 "illustrative" cases 
of cervical-related headaches. Indeed, looked from a more recent perspective, 
those cases could eventually correspond to CH. Important topics such as the 
relatively high frequency, fixed unilaterality of the pain, relation to previous 
trauma, irradiation from the back to the forehead, normal or slightly abnormal 
roentgenograms, and the mechanical precipitation of attacks are some of the 
topics considered by Josey. The female gender was not prevalent in Josey's 
series. Traction and analgesics were basically the recommended treatment. CR is 
probably a common disorder, an idea already considered by a clinician in 1949. 
This syndrome was not adequately described before Sjaastad's group papers in the 
80's.

Headaches commonly affect children and adolescents. Proper diagnosis and 
management is dependent on thorough history taking and a comprehensive physical 
and neurological examination. Additional diagnostic testing is indicated in some 
cases. The second edition of the headache classification system by the 
International Headache Society has recently become available. The classification 
system is primarily based on adults, but we discussed the subtle distinctions 
made regarding children. In addition to the primary headache types of migraine, 
tension-type, and cluster headaches, we discussed selected symptomatic 
headaches. Emphasis was placed on migraine and tension-type headaches because 
these are the most common pediatric headache types. We briefly discussed genetic 
aspects of headaches. Genetic factors have been hypothesized for chronic tension 
headache and other forms of migraine, but genetic linkage has only been 
established for familial hemiplegic migraine. We reviewed the nonpharmacologic 
and pharmacologic therapies, including abortive and prophylactic medications for 
various age groups. Unlike headaches, facial neuralgias are rare in otherwise 
healthy children. Facial pain may be neurological, vascular, or dental in 
origin. We focused on trigeminal neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, 
occipital neuralgia, and Bell's palsy as neurological causes of facial pain in 
children.

Cervicogenic headache: a critical review of the current diagnostic criteria.

Opinions are divided on the use of the term cervicogenic headache (CGH) in cases 
with no evidence of cervical damage. According to Sjaastad et al. (1990), CGH is 
diagnosed from three features: (1) unilateral headache triggered by head/neck 
movements or posture; (2) unilateral headache triggered by pressure on the neck; 
(3) unilateral headache spreading to the neck and the homolateral shoulder/arm. 
Other characteristics are not essential for CGH diagnosis, including pain 
improvement after greater occipital nerve (GON)/C2 block. However, other authors 
give different definitions of CGH, and this may explain why reported frequencies 
for this headache vary so widely. In this paper we critically review the major 
diagnostic criteria of Sjaastad et al. for CGH in the light of clinical studies 
conducted at our institute and other literature findings. In a study of 500 
headaches we found only two patients with unilateral headache triggered by head/ 
neck movements or posture, and no cases of neck pressure-induced headache. No 
clear-cut criteria are given in the literature for differentiating CGH trigger 
points from myofascial trigger points. In another study of 440 primary headache 
patients we found that in the unilateral long-lasting headache group (64 
migraines and 10 tension-type headaches), a pain involving the occiput/neck was 
present in 30 migraine and seven tension headache patients; thus, according to 
the CGH major criteria, 10% (30/307) of 'migraines' and 7% (7/96) of 'tension 
headaches' could be diagnosed as CGH. However, one cannot exclude that the 
association of unilateral pain with posterior irradiation is due to the high 
prevalence of migraine, tension-type headache and chronic neck pain. The 
relation between CGH and whip-lash injury has been put in doubt by a recent 
study which found no difference in headache frequency between trauma and control 
groups and reported no specific headache pattern in the trauma group. Other 
reports suggest that, when it occurs, CGH usually disappears within a year of 
whip-lash, throwing doubt on the appropriateness of surgery for post-traumatic 
CGH. The lack of specificity of GON/C2 block as a treatment for CGH adds further 
difficulties to the diagnosis of this headache. We conclude that, although neck 
structures play a role in the pathophysiology of some headaches, clinical 
patterns indicating a neck-headache relationship have still not been adequately 
defined. We believe that further rigorous studies are needed to definitively 
confirm the validity of CGH as a nosological entity.

Current perspectives on the recognition and diagnosis of low CSF pressure 
headache syndromes.

INTRODUCTION: Headaches occur when cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure drops 
following dural puncture or trauma or spontaneously. As the features of these 
headaches and their accompanying symptoms might not be typical, low CSF pressure 
headache syndromes, and spontaneous intracranial hypotension in particular, are 
often misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed.
AREAS COVERED: The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the most recent 
evidence regarding the clinical presentation and the diagnosis of low CSF 
pressure headache syndromes.
EXPERT OPINION: The clinical spectrum low CSF pressure headache syndromes varies 
significantly and key signs might be missing. Low CSF pressure headache 
syndromes should be included in the differential diagnosis of any case of 
refractory headache, even when the headache is not orthostatic, or there are 
normal neuroimaging findings, and/or lumbar puncture opening pressure is within 
normal limits. Future research should focus on controlled interventional studies 
on the treatment of low CSF pressure headache syndromes, which are currently 
lacking.

A systematic case history is the primary diagnostic tool for headache problems. 
An acute ("thunderclap") headache or progressive subacute headache may have 
sinister implications and warrants urgent investigation. Common recurrent 
headaches (tension-type, migraine and cluster headaches) are not 
life-threatening but can destroy the enjoyment of life. Specific medications are 
available for acute treatment and prophylaxis for most types of recurrent 
headache. General practitioners should be well informed about management, as 
they are the most appropriate people to deal with most headache patients.

Many headache patients present when medications fail, are inadequate, are 
contraindicated, or are not tolerated. These are patients with severe 
disability. Most have daily headaches, including chronic migraine, trigeminal 
autonomic cephalalgias, or other primary headaches. This brief review addresses, 
in broad strokes, some thoughts about alternatives beyond the usual daily oral 
preventive therapies. Do not proceed to more invasive or elaborate approaches 
until the big 3 are done: diagnosis is established, onabotulinumtoxinA 
administered when appropriate, that is, if the patient has chronic migraine, and 
wean is accomplished if the patient has medication overuse headache. Large 
numbers of patients are helped without the need for more arcane and unproven 
treatments by following these initial approaches. Simple nerve blocks can be 
useful in the initial steps, but more invasive blocks and stimulators are not 
recommended until the big 3 are completed. Wean of overused medications must be 
absolute and may require an intravenous bridge over several days, either in an 
infusion unit or inpatient in a medical model. Wean should be accompanied by 
establishing onabotulinumtoxinA or daily prevention from the beginning. Consider 
referral to a structured multidisciplinary headache program. This is for 
patients who require an interdisciplinary approach and may be day-hospital or 
inpatient. Invasive blocks and stimulators may be appropriate, and the latter 
are currently being studied in controlled studies. The most promise, with the 
best balance of efficacy vs adverse event prospects, may be occipital nerve 
stimulators or sphenopalatine ganglion stimulators.

Headaches are very common during childhood and become increasingly frequent 
during adolescence. The diagnosis of primary headache disorders (e.g., migraine 
and tension-type headache) rests principally on clinical criteria as set forth 
by the International Headache Society. Treatment options include acute or 
episodic measures, prophylactic agents and non-pharmacological or behavioural 
interventions. From review of available evidence, the most efficacious acute 
treatments of paediatric migraine include the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
agent ibuprofen at 7.5 - 10 mg/kg/dose or nasal sumatriptan at doses of 5 or 20 
mg. For those patients with headaches that occur with sufficient frequency and 
severity to warrant daily prophylaxis, controlled data are limited. Agents which 
are likely to be beneficial include amitriptyline, flunarizine (not available in 
the US) and cyproheptadine. Clinical experience with the anti-epileptic agents 
topiramate and valproate suggests an expanding role for the prevention of 
paediatric migraine in the future.

Headaches are a common reason for visiting a health care provider. Headaches are 
at times symptomatic of an underlying process that requires prompt diagnosis and 
urgent treatment to reduce threats to life or limb. In this article, the authors 
review the 6 most common presentations for worrisome headache and discuss the 
differential diagnosis. Careful attention to patients' history and physical 
examination and a thoughtful approach to the differential diagnosis will guide 
diagnostic work-up and management. Although benign causes of headache are much 
more common than malignant secondary processes, thorough management of the acute 
headache requires excluding malignant secondary processes.

    Am Fam Physician. 2023 Jul;108(1):97-99.

PURPOSE: To provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the evaluation 
and treatment of primary and secondary headaches in pregnancy and postpartum.
TARGET POPULATION: Pregnant and postpartum patients with a history of or 
experiencing primary or new secondary headaches.
METHODS: This guideline was developed using an a priori protocol in conjunction 
with a writing team consisting of two specialists in obstetrics and gynecology 
appointed by the ACOG Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines-Obstetrics and 
one external subject matter expert. ACOG medical librarians completed a 
comprehensive literature search for primary literature within Cochrane Library, 
Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and 
MEDLINE. Studies that moved forward to the full-text screening stage were 
assessed by two authors from the writing team based on standardized inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. Included studies underwent quality assessment, and a 
modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and 
Evaluation) evidence-to-decision framework was applied to interpret and 
translate the evidence into recommendation statements.
RECOMMENDATIONS: This Clinical Practice Guideline includes recommendations on 
interventions to prevent primary headache in individuals who are pregnant or 
attempting to become pregnant, postpartum, or breastfeeding; evaluation for 
symptomatic patients presenting with primary and secondary headaches during 
pregnancy; and treatment options for primary and secondary headaches during 
pregnancy and lactation. Recommendations are classified by strength and evidence 
quality. Ungraded Good Practice Points are included to provide guidance when a 
formal recommendation could not be made because of inadequate or nonexistent 
evidence.

Managing headache triggers: think 'coping' not 'avoidance'.

Martin PR(1).

Author information:
(1)Division of Psychological Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Vic, 
Australia.

The standard clinical advice for individuals who suffer from recurrent headaches 
is that the best way to prevent headaches is to avoid the triggers. This 
editorial challenges that advice from a number of perspectives. First, there is 
little empirical support for such advice. Second, cognate literatures in the 
fields of chronic pain, stress and anxiety raise concerns about avoidance as a 
strategy. Third, studies have demonstrated that short exposure to a headache 
trigger results in increased sensitivity and prolonged exposure results in 
decreased sensitivity. Conclusions include that one aetiological pathway to 
developing a primary headache disorder may be via attempts to avoid triggers 
resulting in increased sensitivity to triggers. Also, clinicians need to become 
more flexible in the advice they give pertaining to triggers, namely they should 
think 'coping with triggers' rather than avoiding all triggers, as avoidance 
will sometimes be the preferred strategy, but often it will not be.

Post-craniotomy headache: a clinical view with a focus on the persistent form.

Author information:

PE, Brazil.

Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Post-craniotomy headache is a frequent complication of neurosurgical 
procedures and is often a challenge for neurosurgeons, neurologists, and 
headache specialists.
METHOD: This was a narrative review.
RESULTS: Surgical trauma, adherence of the musculature to the dura mater, 
peripheral nerve injury, development of neurinomas in the surgical scar, and 
central sensitization may be involved in the genesis of such headaches. 
Performing smaller craniotomies, replacement of the bone (craniotomy), 
performing cranioplasty, and infiltration of the surgical site with local 
anesthesia at the end of the surgical procedure are strategies used to prevent 
such headaches. Among the most frequent characteristics of post-craniotomy 
headaches are that they start on the first days after the operation, are located 
on the same side as and at the site of the surgical scar, and improve with the 
passage of time. Depression, anxiety, and temporomandibular disorders are 
frequently associated with these headaches. Abortive treatment such as opioids, 
ordinary analgesics, non-hormonal anti-inflammatory drugs, and triptans can be 
administered. There have been reports of improvements using sodium divalproex, 
verapamil, and local anesthetics.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-craniotomy headaches can have significant repercussions on 
patients' quality of life. There is a need for clinical trials evaluating 
therapeutic options for treatment of this type of headache.

Pediatric headache: Are the red flags misleading or prognostic?

BACKGROUND: Symptoms and findings called orange or red flags may indicate the 
etiology of pediatric headaches and may point to a life-threatening situation 
requiring urgent treatment and thus can alter patient management. These findings 
can be either misleading or prognostic for clinicians. We aimed to identify the 
etiology and prognostic value of orange/red flags in pediatric patients.
METHODS: This study included 810 children with headaches who underwent 
neuroimaging due to the existence of orange/red flags. Their hospital records 
were examined to obtain demographical, clinical, laboratory data, and 
re-classify the headaches and determine orange/red flags on admission.
RESULTS: Secondary causes were identified in 17.0% (n: 138) of patients, 
however, those who were diagnosed with a life-threatening headache that required 
emergency treatment were 5.2% of all patients and 30.4% of the patients 
diagnosed with a secondary headache. Those with secondary headaches and with 
life threatening secondary headaches which required urgent treatment were 
younger (p = 0,018, p = 0,022), had more emergency department visits 
(p < 0,001), and acute onsets (p < 0,001). Red flags, like systemic symptoms 
(p < 0,001), sudden onset (p = 0,023, p = 0.039), papilledema (p < 0,001), and 
progressive headaches (p = 0,048, p = 0.006), were more common with secondary 
headaches and its subgroup, while headache awakening from sleep (p = 0.009) and 
family history of primary headache (P > 0,001) were more common in primary 
headaches. No correlation existed between the number of red flags and etiology. 
However, older age (p = 0,001) and a shorter duration between symptoms and 
admission (p = 0,032), and the number of emergency service visits (p = 0,020) 
increased with increasing red flags.
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians always look for flags when they encounter patients with 
headaches, which is a common symptom, so as not to overlook anything. However, 
red flags do not always mean that the underlying cause requires emergency 
treatment and the severity of the cause is not correlated with the number of 
flags.

Headaches are synonymous with neurovascular pain (cephalalgias), which comprise 
a heterogeneous group of pain disorders that share a common anatomic region 
(head and neck). Headaches are often a "universal" disease presentation that is 
evaluated by the oral and maxillofacial surgeon. Pharmacologic therapy of 
headaches is most often based on the severity of symptoms and the degree of 
disability experienced by the patient. This article describes the epidemiology 
of neurovascular headaches, their pathophysiologic mechanisms/presentation, the 
workup of patients, and an up-to-date overview of pharmacologic approaches that 
can be applied in the oral and maxillofacial surgical practice to treat this 
patient population.

The presence of autonomic symptoms can make the diagnosis of headache 
challenging. While commonly seen with the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, 
autonomic dysfunction can also be present in patients with migraine, or with a 
variety of secondary headaches. The pathophysiology of cranial autonomic 
symptoms in headache is based between the trigeminal system and the 
hypothalamus. This article will review the pathophysiology and presence of 
autonomic dysfunction in headache and will provide techniques to help in 
headache diagnosis in patients with autonomic dysfunction.

Headache and the cervical spine: a critical review.

Pöllmann W(1), Keidel M, Pfaffenrath V.

Author information:
(1)Marianne Strauss-Klinik, Berg, Germany.

Headache related to the cervical spine is often misdiagnosed and treated 
inadequately because of confusing and varying terminology. Primary headaches 
such as tension-type headache and migraine are incorrectly categorized as 
"cervicogenic" merely because of their occipital localization. Cervicogenic 
headache as described by Sjaastad presents as a unilateral headache of 
fluctuating intensity increased by movement of the head and typically radiates 
from occipital to frontal regions. Definition, pathophysiology; differential 
diagnoses and therapy of cervicogenic headache are demonstrated. Ipsilateral 
blockades of the C2 root and/or greater occipital nerve allow a differentiation 
between cervicogenic headache and primary headache syndromes such as migraine or 
tension-type headache. Neither pharmacological nor surgical or chiropractic 
procedures lead to a significant improvement or remission of cervicogenic 
headache. Pains of various anatomical regions possibly join into a common 
anatomical pathway, then present as cervicogenic headache, which should 
therefore be understood as a homogeneous but also unspecific pattern of 
reaction.

Headaches.

Liu A.

Headaches are common in the pediatric population and can cause significant 
distress to the patient and their family. The ability of pediatricians to 
appropriately diagnose and differentiate headaches is important to guide 
management. This article reviews the epidemiology, classification, and treatment 
of headaches, including migraines. [Pediatr Ann. 2021;50(12):e479-e485].

Cervicogenic headache describes pain referred along the upper three cervical 
roots and is a common source of headache in the over fifties. A review of 
clinical features, anatomy, and investigations using neural blockade shows 
several clinical pictures. Diseases of the cranio-vertebral junction, e.g. 
syringomyelia, and tonsilar descent, can produce mechanical or hydrodynamic head 
and neck pain. Pre-existent migraine and tension headache may be precipitated or 
aggravated by cervical spondylosis, but the anatomical mechanism is unclear. 
Headaches which arise from and are primarily caused by disorders in the cervical 
spine are exemplified by spondylosis and acute whiplash injury, but are usually 
transient. Evidence for a cervicogenic mechanism of chronic whiplash headache 
is, however, lacking.

Headaches are one of the most common causes of consultation in primary care. Due 
to their polymorphic character and sometimes severe etiologies, it is very 
important to properly classify these symptoms and to look for possible 
associated signs of severity. It is with this objective that the international 
classification of headache delivered its 3rd version in 2018 with the ICHD-3. In 
addition, revised and validated severity criteria were also published in 2018 
under the name SNNOOP10. At the same time, the concept of green flags which 
could allow to diagnose a primary headache without further investigations has 
emerged. In terms of treatment, the development of CGRP neuropeptide antagonists 
has allowed a major advance in the treatment of the severe forms of migraine. 
Finally, integrative medicine is taking on a central role.

a émergé. En termes de traitement, le développement d’antagonistes du 
neuropeptide CGRP (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide) a permis une avancée majeure 
dans le traitement des formes de migraine sévères. La médecine intégrative y 
prend par ailleurs une place centrale.

Australia.

Headache is a vast field with many different varieties of headaches and 
classifications. However, all headaches have a common anatomy and physiology. 
All headaches are mediated by the trigeminocervical nucleus, and are initiated 
by noxious stimulation of the endings of the nerves that synapse on this 
nucleus, by irritation of the nerves themselves, or by disinhibition of the 
nucleus. A mastery of the relevant anatomy and physiology of the 
trigeminocervical nociceptive system serves to predict and summarise the many 
varieties of headache systematically and with reference to their mechanisms.

Tension-type headache: psychosomatic clinical assessment and treatment.

Biondi M(1), Portuesi G.

Author information:
(1)Terza Clinica Psichiatrica, Università La Sapienza, Roma, Italy.

Tension-type headache (TTH) is an ill-defined nosographic entity. The 
classification of headaches according to the Headache Classification Committee 
of the International Headache Society is closer to clinical reality with respect 
to the past classification. From an aetiopathological standpoint, hypotheses 
trying to explain primary headache disorders in a unified way are interesting. 
The treatment of this disorder requires a thorough diagnostic framing, which 
should take into account its psychosomatic aspects, focusing on the individual 
patient and his history. In fact, the many studies which aimed at characterising 
the disorder from a psychological viewpoint are not able to provide 
generalizable indications. In the same way, as it appears that none of the 
currently available treatments (drugs, biofeedback and psychotherapy) 
demonstrates clear superiority over the others, the choice should involve an 
intervention targeted on those factors which are held to be most important in an 
individual patient. Finally, as for acupuncture and other physical therapies, 
although interesting results are reported, these treatments are difficult to 
assess and should be reserved to particular cases.

Obtructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disorder in the general 
population with an estimated prevalence in an adult population of 2% in women 
and 4% in men. Although several studies have suggested that headaches, 
particularly morning headaches, are more common in patients with OSAS than in 
normal subjects, others have yielded contradictory findings. When the 
sleep-related breathing disorder was treated with success, the headache 
generally disappeared, supporting a causal role of the sleep disorder for 
headache. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the relationship 
between OSAS and the occurrence of headache, particularly on awakening. 
Night-time fluctuations of oxygen saturation during the night with hypercapnia, 
vasodilatation, increased intracranial pressure and impaired sleep quality are 
all considered contributing factors. However the exact mechanisms of headache 
pathogenesis and the relationship between OSAS, headache and morning headaches 
in particular remain controversial.

Headaches remain one of the most common reasons for patients to seek acute care. 
It is important to assess whether the headache meets criteria for a primary 
(uncomplicated) versus a secondary headache, due to an underlying condition. A 
thorough history and physical examination are imperative when assessing the 
nature of the headache and to rule out red-flag features, which are signs and 
symptoms of dangerous causes. This will help determine if imaging studies are 
warranted. Management of uncomplicated headache should include treatment of the 
acute headache and an action plan for reducing the frequency and severity of 
future headaches.

When and how to investigate the patient with headache.

Bartleson JD(1).

Author information:

SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.

The very common symptom of headache most often has a benign cause and can 
usually be diagnosed following a thorough history and neurologic and focused 
general physical examinations. Because the potential etiologies can threaten 
life and neurological function, headaches provoke understandable concern on the 
part of the patient and health care provider. Thoughtful testing can exclude the 
worrisome underlying causes. This article reviews the neurological and general 
symptoms and signs that should prompt diagnostic testing and the specific 
diagnostic studies that are recommended. The worrisome factors include recent 
head or neck injury; a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt-onset headache; headache 
brought on by exertion or Valsalva maneuver/cough; new headache in the patient 
over the age of 50; neurological symptoms and/or abnormal signs; systemic 
symptoms and/or signs; and secondary risk factors such as a history of cancer or 
human immunodeficiency virus infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake 
the patient from sleep at night, side-locked headaches, and prominent effect of 
change in posture on the pain. The diagnostic investigations include 
neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid examination, and blood testing in specific 
situations.

New thoughts on sinus headache.

Tepper SJ(1).

Author information:

Sinus headache is not a recognized entity by allergy, otolaryngology, or 
neurological organizations. Headache is a minor feature in the diagnosis of 
acute rhinosinusitis and is not validated as a symptom in chronic sinusitis. 
Sinus headaches are self-diagnosed due to weather triggers, bilateral and 
frontomaxillary location, and the presence of vasomotor signs and symptoms, all 
of which can accompany the migraine. Over 90% of self-diagnosed and 
doctor-diagnosed sinus headaches meet the International Headache Society 
criteria for migraines, and those migraines misdiagnosed as sinus headaches 
respond to sumatriptan better than placebo because migraines respond to 
triptans. Sinus headaches are usually severely disabling migraines, misdiagnosed 
and mistreated, with 61% of patients receiving antibiotic prescriptions for 
noninfectious causes, thus failing the patients and, in addition, contributing 
to a serious public health problem.

Drug abuse in headache patients.

Elkind AH(1).

Author information:
(1)Elkind Headache Center, Mount Vernon, NY 10550.

A significant percentage of chronic headache sufferers use excessive quantities 
of substances for relief. Drug dependency is frequent in these patients. 
Patients have an impaired lifestyle, sustain organ system damage, may suffer a 
withdrawal syndrome, and continue to have headaches. Drug abuse must cease 
before a satisfactory remission occurs. Particular attention is directed to 
ergotamine, butalbital, analgesics, and caffeine. The mechanism of substance 
abuse may be related to repeated use of substances that reinforce behavior and 
stimulate brain reward systems. Treatment includes comprehensive diagnostic 
workup, withdrawal of the agent, and use of headache preventives. 
beta-Adrenergic blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase (MAO) 
inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents may be of value. Behavior 
modification and dietary counseling are also helpful.

Many people experience headaches that do not fulfill the International Headache 
Society's criteria for a specific headache disorder, yet behave biologically 
like that disorder. Others fulfill criteria for one headache disorder but have 
features of another. To explain these observations, we propose that groups of 
neurons, called modules, become activated to produce each symptom of a primary 
headache disorder, and that each module is linked to other modules that together 
produce an individual's headache. Headaches develop phenotypic stability through 
a process referred to as learned stereotypy. This theory has implications for 
the classification, research, and treatment of primary and secondary headache 
patients.

nummular headache have not been studied, medical practitioners are unfamiliar 
with the clinical features and approaches to therapy. Statistics of this type of 
cephalgia in children is unknown. The article analyzes the literature data of 
recent years related to this problem. The details of the clinical features are 
considered using a case example.

In a given year, over 5% of persons in the United States seek medical care for 
headaches, most often seeing their primary care physician. The five cases here 
review diagnosis and treatment of migraine and other primary headaches, 
medication rebound headaches, and headaches in the elderly including temporal 
arteritis. Although headaches (along with dizziness and back pain) may be one of 
the least preferred diseases internists see, the increasing number of effective 
treatments may favorably change this opinion and result in better care for their 
patients.

Cervicogenic headache after whiplash injury.

Drottning M(1).

0407 Oslo, Norway. monica.d@online.no

Cervicogenic headache (CEH) with pain radiating from the neck to the forehead is 
a common finding after whiplash injury. In most whiplash studies, the whiplash 
headaches are not defined. Post-whiplash CEH typically is a moderate headache 
with a benign, but often prolonged course. It probably is unilateral and 
bilateral. Reduced neck mobility does not seem to be as common after whiplash as 
in chronic CEH in general. Post-whiplash CEH is accompanied by great disability 
and high use of medication. Although the natural course seems favorable for 
unilateral CEH during the first postinjury years, some patients will need 
specific treatment for their headaches. There is a lack of controlled studies to 
guide practitioners to choose investigations and treatment for chronic CEH.

Acute and chronic whiplash headache are new diagnostic entities in the ICHD-2 
(5.3, 5.4). In a prospective cohort study, 210 rear-end collision victims were 
identified consecutively from police records and asked about head and neck pain 
in questionnaires after 2 weeks, 3 months and 1 year. The results were compared 
with those of matched controls who were also followed for 1 year. Of 210 
accident victims, 75 developed headache within 7 days. Of these, 37 had also 
neck pain and complied with the criteria for acute whiplash headache. These 37 
had the same headache diagnoses, headache features, accompanying symptoms and 
long-term prognosis as the 38 without initial neck pain who therefore did not 
comply with the acute whiplash headache diagnosis. Previous headache was a major 
risk factor for headache both in the acute and chronic stage. Compared with the 
non-traumatized controls, headache in the whiplash group had the same 
prevalence, the same diagnoses and characteristic features, and the same 
prognosis. Both acute and chronic whiplash headache lack specificity compared 
with the headache in a control group, and have the same long-term prognosis, 
indicating that such headaches are primary headaches, probably elicited by the 
stress of the situation.

    Headache. 2015 Apr;55(4):580-1. doi: 10.1111/head.12542.

Ictal headaches are increasingly becoming the focus of research as more data 
demonstrate headaches existing as a sole manifestation of an epileptic event. 
Due to the difficulty in diagnosing the event as an epileptic phenomenon as 
opposed to a migraine, the condition is often misdiagnosed. This paper seeks to 
review the current published literature on ictal epileptic headaches as well as 
provide differentiation between ictal headaches and similarly presenting 
conditions. In doing so, we hope to improve the diagnosis of ictal headaches and 
thus improve patient care. We review two case studies that exemplify the 
potential of multiple conditions with comparable symptoms to ictal headaches, 
and discuss how to differentiate the variable diagnoses. As of the writing of 
this paper, there is no universally agreed upon set of features of ictal 
headaches; however, reviewing the current literature, there do seem to be 
several features that should be noted when treating patients. More research on 
the pathophysiology of ictal epileptic headaches needs to be done before the 
condition can be fully understood.

OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to determine the prevalence and nature of cannabis 
use in patients with headache in a tertiary headache clinic and to explore 
patients' empiric experience in using cannabinoids therapeutically.
BACKGROUND: Many patients with headache report cannabinoid use as an effective 
abortive and/or preventive therapy. Mounting evidence implicates cannabinoids in 
pain mechanisms pertaining to migraine and other headache types.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study surveyed 200 patients presenting with any 
headache disorder to a tertiary headache clinic in Calgary, Alberta. Descriptive 
analyses were applied to capture information about headache diagnoses and the 
frequency, doses and methods of cannabinoid delivery employed, as well as 
patients' perceptions of therapeutic benefit and selected negative side effects.
RESULTS: Active cannabinoid users comprised 34.0% of respondents. Approximately 
40% of respondents using cannabinoids engaged in very frequent use (≥300 
days/year). Of cannabinoid modalities, liquid concentrates were most popular 
(39.2%), followed by smoked cannabis (33.3%). Patients endorsed cannabinoid use 
for both prevention and acute therapy of headaches, often concurrently. Sixty 
percent of respondents felt cannabinoids reduced headache severity, while 29.2% 
perceived efficacy in aborting headaches. Nearly 5% of respondents volunteered 
that they had encountered a serious problem such as an argument, fight, 
accident, or work issue as a result of their cannabis use. Approximately 35.4% 
of users had attempted to reduce their use.
CONCLUSION: This survey shows that over one-third of patients with headache 
disorders in a tertiary headache clinic use cannabis as a treatment for their 
headaches. Of these, about 25% and 60% perceive improvements in headache 
frequency and severity, respectively. The results of this survey will aid 
neurologists and headache specialists in understanding the landscape of 
cannabinoid use in a more severely affected population and inform 
future-controlled studies of cannabinoids in headache patients.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to validate a semi-quantitative composite score 
tool, "Headache Gauge" (HG), to monitor the treatment effect in primary 
headaches in everyday clinic practice, adjustable to any chosen timeframe.
METHOD: A cohort validation study of HG was performed in primary headache 
patients, recovering their clinical data and patient-related outcome measures 
(PROMs) for headache (HIT-6, MIDAS, HURT), work impact (WPAIQ), quality-of-life 
(SF-12), and mood (STAI, ZUNG). HG score distribution, its relation to clinical 
variables, its internal consistency, and its convergent validity were 
determined.
RESULTS: HG was plotted in 233 patients: 90.1% females, age average 37 years, 
86% with migraine, 27% with chronic headaches, and 28% with medication overuse. 
HG ranged from 0.21 to 58.3 in this sample, higher in chronic headaches (HG 16) 
and medication overuse (HG 15). HG presented good concurrent validity, 
significantly correlating with HIT-6 (p < 0.0001), SF-12 (p = 0.001), WPAIQ 
(p < 0.0001), MIDAS (p < 0.0001), and HURT (p < 0.0001). Good sensitivity to 
change (p < 0.001) and moderate test-retest reliability (p = 0.001) were 
calculated after reassessment of 147 patients (63.1% of the initial sample).
CONCLUSIONS: Headache Gauge is a clinical data-based outcome measure that 
conceptually translates the percentage of lost time to headache in any given 
timeframe. It relates to headache impact, therefore bearing the potential to be 
relevant in real-life clinical monitoring.

Indomethacin-responsive headaches are a heterogeneous group of primary headache 
disorders distinguished by their swift and often absolute response to 
indomethacin. The epidemiology of these conditions is incompletely defined. 
Traditionally, indomethacin-responsive headaches include a subset of trigeminal 
autonomic cephalalgias (paroxysmal hemicrania and hemicrania continua), 
Valsalva-induced headaches (cough headache, exercise headache, and sex 
headache), primary stabbing headache, and hypnic headache. These headache 
syndromes differ in extent of response to indomethacin, clinical features, and 
differential diagnoses. Neuroimaging is recommended to investigate for various 
organic causes that may mimic these headaches. Case reports of other primary 
headache disorders that also respond to indomethacin, such as cluster headache, 
nummular headache, and ophthalmoplegic migraine, have been described. These 
"novel" indomethacin-responsive headaches beg the question of what headache 
characteristics are required to qualify a headache as an indomethacin-responsive 
headache. Furthermore, they challenge the concept of using a therapeutic 
intervention as a diagnostic criterion.

A patient is suspected of suffering from a potentially life threatening headache 
according to the following typical warning signs: sudden onset headache, worst 
headache, neurological findings, fever, neck stiffness, epileptic seizures and 
deterioration of vigilance. It is far more dangerous not to recognize 
potentially life threatening headaches like subarachnoid bleeding, meningitis, 
encephalitis, arterial dissection or epidural hematoma than to over diagnose it. 
Immediate and specific neurological and radiological investigations (CT, MRI, 
CSF) are necessary in each patient presenting with those findings. The morbidity 
and mortality of those patients mainly depend on the beginning of the therapy. 
This article focuses on the diagnosis of potentially life threatening headache 
disorders.

Tension headache.

Ziegler DK.

Headache is an extremely common symptom, and many headaches undoubtedly have a 
relationship to stressful situations. The clear definition, however, of a 
"tension headache" complex and its differentiation from migraine in some 
patients is difficult. The problems are in the identification of a specific 
headache pattern induced by stress or "tension" and the relationship of the 
symptom to involuntary contraction of neck and scalp muscles. Treatment consists 
of analgesics and occasionally mild tranquilizers. Psychotherapy consists of 
reassurance and often other supportive measures, including modification of life 
styles. Various feedback techniques have been reported of value, but their 
superiority to suggestion and hypnosis is still problematic.

Many people experience headaches that do not fulfil the International Headache 
Society's criteria for a specific headache disorder yet behave biologically like 
that disorder. Others fulfil criteria for one headache disorder and yet have 
features of another disorder. To explain these observations, we propose that 
groups of neurones called modules become activated to produce each symptom of a 
primary headache disorder, and that each module is linked to other modules that 
together produce an individual's headache. This theory has implications for the 
classification, research and treatment of primary and secondary headache 
patients.

Classification, mechanisms, and management of headache.

Repschlaeger BJ, McPherson MA.

Classification, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and therapy of migraine, cluster, 
and muscle-contraction (tension) headaches are reviewed. Migraine headache is 
related to vasomotor changes and is often preceded or accompanied by neurologic 
symptoms, nausea, and vomiting. Ergot alkaloids are used in acute migraine 
episodes; products containing caffeine are sometimes used for synergy. Other 
agents including antiemetic and sedative drugs and a combination product 
containing isometheptene mucate , dichloralphenazone , and acetaminophen have 
been used. Methysergide is the drug of choice for migraine prophylaxis. Of all 
patients with cluster headache, 90% experience episodes that occur in series 
separated by intervals as short as one week or as long as 25 years, and the 
remaining 10% have chronic headache. Pain is unilateral, nausea and vomiting are 
rare, and there is no aura. Pathophysiology is thought to be similar to that of 
migraine. Supportive treatment includes drug therapy to improve sleep and 
avoidance of alcohol and vasodilating agents. Aerosol ergot preparations may be 
effective for treatment of acute episodes . Prednisone has been used both as an 
abortive agent and for prophylaxis, while ergotamine, methysergide, and lithium 
have been tried prophylactically. Chronic tension headache is a constant, tight, 
pressing, or bandlike sensation in the frontal, temporal, or occipital area that 
occurs daily. The deep, steady ache differs from the throbbing sensation of 
vascular headache. Constant overcontraction of scalp muscles may be a cause. 
Heat, massage, and stretching are used to alleviate excess muscle contraction. 
Tension headache has been treated with analgesics, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory agents, muscle relaxants, and amitriptyline. Drug treatment of 
headache must be based on headache type and tailored to individual response. 
Bio-feedback may be useful in some patients when combined with drugs.

Headaches are a common complaint for most women during their lifetime, including 
gestation and puerperium. Tension-type headaches and migraine flare-ups are the 
most common headache complications after delivery, but the differential 
diagnosis of postpartum headache is broad. The clinician must distinguish common 
headache syndromes from dangerous causes of postpartum headache. We will focus 
on early postpartum headaches in the form of case discussions that will include 
clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria, and treatment.

Animal models of headache: from bedside to bench and back to bedside.

Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94115, USA.

In recent years bench-based studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of 
headache pathophysiology, while facilitating the development of new headache 
medicines. At present, established animal models of headache utilize activation 
of pain-producing cranial structures, which for a complex syndrome, such as 
migraine, leaves many dimensions of the syndrome unstudied. The focus on 
modeling the central nociceptive mechanisms and the complexity of sensory 
phenomena that accompany migraine may offer new approaches for the development 
of new therapeutics. Given the complexity of the primary headaches, multiple 
approaches and techniques need to be employed. As an example, recently a model 
for trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias has been tested successfully, while by 
contrast, a satisfactory model of tension-type headache has been elusive. 
Moreover, although useful in many regards, migraine models are yet to provide a 
more complete picture of the disorder.

"WHICH Headache to Investigate, WHEN, and HOW?".

Ravishankar K(1).

Research Centre, Lilavati Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai, India.

PREMISE: Headache is a common problem in medical practice. The International 
Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3 beta)1 divides all headaches into 
two broad categories. Most headaches seen in practice belong to the category of 
primary headaches, where there is no underlying structural cause identifiable. 
Less than 10% headaches in practice belong to the category of secondary 
headaches where there is an underlying condition, that can sometimes be ominous 
and life-threatening.
PROBLEM: Fear of missing a treatable serious secondary headache disorder is the 
most important reason why we need to investigate headache patients. There is no 
dilemma in investigating the patient when the clinical presentation is 
straightforward but when the headache presents differently or with 'red flags,' 
it can sometimes be quite challenging to order the right investigation and 
rapidly arrive at the right diagnosis.
POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS: This article looks at some of the elusive headache 
scenarios and outlines an approach that addresses the issue of 'appropriate' 
investigation in the headache patient. With advancing technology and increasing 
expertise, the author feels it is time now to do away with the practice of 
ordering an exhaustive battery of tests in all headache patients. With 
experience, clinicians can learn to choose tests judiciously and order specific 
tests based on a working diagnosis. As the title suggests, knowing 'WHEN to 
order WHAT test in WHICH headache patient? ' forms the theme of this article.

The high incidence and prevalence of headaches in the pediatric population has a 
significant impact on patients and their families. Migraine, the most common 
headache disorder for which pediatric patients see a physician, remains 
underdiagnosed. Recent studies have revealed the increasing incidence of 
migraine and chronic migraine in the pediatric population. This article presents 
limitations of the present diagnostic criteria for migraine, and the proposed 
modifications to these criteria may assist the clinician with early recognition. 
Further research in pediatric headaches is needed to help reveal additional 
pathophysiologic mechanisms and improve diagnostic criteria.

California, San Francisco, California.

The challenge of headache management in the hospital can be divided into the 
diagnostic and management issues encountered in the emergency department, and 
the issues involved in the inpatient management of chronic refractory headaches. 
The two endeavors are different but linked because of overlapping diagnostic and 
treatment options. In addition, the problem of the intractable acute headache 
encountered in the emergency department can evolve into inpatient care of the 
same patient who has failed to respond to acute treatment. Here the author 
presents an approach to the patient with severe acute headache in the emergency 
department and explores the options available for managing intractable headaches 
in the inpatient setting.

Sinus headache is a widely accepted clinical diagnosis, although many medical 
specialists consider it an uncommon cause of recurrent headaches. The 
inappropriate diagnosis of sinus headache can lead to unnecessary diagnostic 
studies, surgical interventions, and medical treatments. Both the International 
Headache Society and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck 
Surgery have attempted to define conditions that lead to headaches of rhinogenic 
origin but have done so from different perspectives and in isolation of each 
other. An interdisciplinary ad hoc committee convened to discuss the role of 
sinus disease as a cause of headache and to review recent epidemiological 
studies that suggest sinus headache (headache of rhinogenic origin) and migraine 
are frequently confused with one another. This committee reviewed available 
scientific evidence from multiple disciplines and concluded that considerable 
research and clinical study are required to further understand and delineate the 
role of nasal pathology and autonomic activation in migraine and headaches of 
rhinogenic origin. However, this group agreed that greater diagnostic and 
therapeutic attention needs to be given to patients with sinus headaches.

Our multidimensional classification of headache uses on the one hand the 
phenomenological main criteria. Id est: attack-featured headaches versus the 
more permanent headaches. On the other hand the main etiological factors have to 
be traced: heredity, vasomotor-dysfunction, disturbances of cervical spine, 
metabolic disturbances, psychodynamics. As the majority of 90% chronical 
headaches have a multifactorial etiology, these factors have to be taken into 
consideration one by one. Usually more than one is to be found. Such 
differential diagnosis forms already a clear way into differentiated therapy. 
Our classification is conform to patient and to daily medical practice, easy to 
execute and, last not least, has a statistically proven small inter-examiner 
variation. The nowadays discussed IHS-classification we see contrarely to ours 
and to the demands of a good classification. Same counts for the classification 
that is put on by the ICD-9. First is to big, second is to small to be useful. 
Moreover, both show quite a number of clearly definable faults, which are 
opposite to clinical reality.
